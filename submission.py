# being in a tile using exact updates (correct, but slow times).

    # Problem 1:
    # Function: Observe (update the probabilities based on an observation)
    # -----------------
    # Takes |self.belief| -- an object of class Belief, defined in util.py --
    # and updates it in place based on the distance observation $d_t$ and
    # your position $a_t$.
    #
    # - agentX: x location of your car (not the one you are tracking)
    # - agentY: y location of your car (not the one you are tracking)
    # - observedDist: true distance plus a mean-zero Gaussian with standard
    #                 deviation Const.SONAR_STD
    #
    # Notes:
    # - Convert row and col indices into locations using util.rowToY and util.colToX.
    # - util.pdf: computes the probability density function for a Gaussian
    # - Although the gaussian pdf is symmetric with respect to the mean and value,
    #   you should pass arguments to util.pdf in the correct order
    # - Don't forget to normalize self.belief after you update its probabilities!

    # Problem 2:
    # Function: Elapse Time (propose a new belief distribution based on a learned transition model)
    # ---------------------
    # Takes |self.belief| and updates it based on the passing of one time step.
    # Notes:
    # - Use the transition probabilities in self.transProb, which is a dictionary
    #   containing all the ((oldTile, newTile), transProb) key-val pairs that you
    #   must consider.
    # - If there are ((oldTile, newTile), transProb) pairs not in self.transProb,
    #   they are assumed to have zero probability, and you can safely ignore them.
    # - Use the addProb (or setProb) and getProb methods of the Belief class to modify
    #   and access the probabilities associated with a belief.  (See util.py.)
    # - Be careful that you are using only the CURRENT self.belief distribution to compute
    #   updated beliefs.  Don't incrementally update self.belief and use the updated value
    #   for one grid square to compute the update for another square.
    # - Don't forget to normalize self.belief after all probabilities have been updated!
    #   (so that the sum of probabilities is exactly 1 as otherwise adding/multiplying
    #    small floating point numbers can lead to sum being close to but not equal to 1)
